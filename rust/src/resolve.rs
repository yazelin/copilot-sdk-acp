//! Internal resolution of the GitHub Copilot CLI binary.
//!
//! Resolution order:
//!
//! 1. An explicit path supplied by the application via
//!    [`CliProgram::Path`](crate::CliProgram::Path).
//! 2. The `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable.
//! 3. The bundled CLI embedded in this crate at build time (when the
//!    `bundled-cli` cargo feature is on, the default).
//! 4. The build-time-extracted CLI in the per-user cache (when
//!    `bundled-cli` is off).
//!
//! There is no PATH scanning and no walking of standard install locations.
//! If none of the above resolves to a real file,
//! [`Client::start`](crate::Client::start) returns
//! an [`ErrorKind::BinaryNotFound`](crate::ErrorKind::BinaryNotFound) error.
